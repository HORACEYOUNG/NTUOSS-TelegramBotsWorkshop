## Task 0 - Getting Started

#### 0.1 Introduction

<!-- TODO: write about this workshop -->
<!-- TODO: write about telegram -->

For this tutorial, we'll be creating a *Cat Bot* which allows users to
1. get random facts about cats
2. get random cat pictures
3. talk to an actual cat *LIVE*\*

#### 0.2 Initial Setup

1.  Download a text editor of your choice. I strongly recommend either:
    1.  [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    2.  [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
    3.  [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
2.  Download [this project](https://github.com/clarencecastillo/NTUOSS-TelegramBotsWorkshop/archive/master.zip) and unzip the folder to your preferred workspace to get started.
3.  Download [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/) if you want easier access to quickly debug your bot.
4.  Download required Python 3.6.x packages:
    1.  [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot)
    2.  [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests)
    1.  [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

> **Note**<br>
> The easiest way to install python modules is via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Running this one-liner will install all of the required modules indicated above:
> <br>`pip install telepot requests beautifulsoup4`

## Task 1 - BotFather

#### 1.1 Name Your Cat Bot

Since we need unique names for our Cat Bots, you can name your bot after your very own cat (or the cat you've never had). That way, BotFather won't likely complain about reserved usernames. If you don't have a cat, I've compiled a *Cat Name Matrix* aka "What's Your Cat Name" that could help you name your cat bot:

**Step 1:** Sum of the digits in your Matriculation Number mod 10
| Number | Name | Number | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `Mister` | 5 | `Moon` |
| 1 | `Miss` | 6 | `Sir` |
| 2 | `Lord` | 7 | `Captain` |
| 3 | `Lady` | 8 | `General` |
| 4 | `Princess` | 9 | `Professor` |

<br>**Step 2:** First initial of your given name
| Letter | Name | Letter | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | `Fluffy` | n | `Cuddles` |
| b | `Banana` | o | `Sparkly` |
| c | `Rainbow` | p | `Fatty` |
| d | `Mainbitch` | q | `Querty` |
| e | `Buddy` | r | `Hairy` |
| f | `Kissy` | s | `Sassy` |
| g | `Bitchy` | t | `Motherfucker` |
| h | `Kitty` | u | `Cutiepie` |
| i | `Handsome` | v | `Scratchy` |
| j | `Stormy` | w | `Moon` |
| k | `Pussy` | x | `Pouncey` |
| l | `Spiderpig` | y | `Lucky` |
| m | `Midnight` | z | `Snowy` |

<br>**Step 3:** Your GPA times your day of birth mod 10
| Digit | Name | Digit | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0  | `Bellyrubs` | 5 | `Waggles` |
| 1 | `Purbox` | 6 | `Furface` |
| 2 | `Wiggles` | 7 | `Fluffles` |
| 3 | `Munchkin` | 8 | `Moon` |
| 4 | `Cheeks` | 9 | `Meowers` |

For example, if my matriculation number is U1359234X, my cat bot's honorific would be `Captain` as derived from `(1+3+5+9+2+3+4)%10 = 7` . Combined with my name's first initial `C` (which maps to `Rainbow`) and given my *5.0* GPA times the day of my birth 20, `5.0*20%10 = 0` (which maps to `Bellyrubs`), my cat bot's full name would be `Captain Rainbow Bellyrubs`. Consequently, my cat bot's username would be `captainrainbowbellyrubscatbot`.

#### 1.2 Acquire Telegram HTTP API Token

Once we've got our Cat Bot name settled, the next step is to acquire a token from Telegram. To do this, we need to let BotFather know that we want to create a bot. Open Telegram and search for *BotFather* in the contacts search field. Ask it to register a new bot for you by sending the command `/newbot` after which it'll ask you for your bot's name and username.

![task 1.2 screenshot](screenshots/task_1_2.png?raw=true)

Take note of our new bot's token to access Telegram's HTTP API as we'll need it in the code we're about to write so we can tell Telegram the behavior of our cat bot.

The token should look something like this:

```
2351749591:VskzWEJdWj_rlCx23Hyu5mIJdWjTVskzdEx
```

#### 1.3 Meow! Hello World

![task 1.3 screenshot a](screenshots/task_1_3_a.png?raw=true)

Now that we got everything we need to start developing our bot, let's start programming to define the behavioral aspects of our Cat Bot. To start off, open `catbot/catbot.py` on your text editor and paste the following after the line where it says *WRITE YOUR CODES BELOW THIS LINE*:

```python
TOKEN = '' # <-- your token goes here

def on_chat_message(msg):

    content_type, chat_type, chat_id = telepot.glance(msg)

    # default response (feel free to change it)
    response = 'Meow!'

    # handle only messages with text content
    if content_type == 'text':

        # get message payload
        msg_text = msg['text']
        msg_sender = msg['from']['username']
        print('Received: "' + msg_text + '" from ' + msg_sender)

        # prepare response
        response += ' Hi ' + msg_sender + '. Hello world! '

    # send the response
    bot.sendMessage(chat_id, response)
```

Let's bring our bot to life by running it. If you didn't get any errors this far, you should be able to test your bot by talking to it via Telegram Desktop. Enter your bot's username in the contacts search field and press `start` to begin the conversation. Remember that bots cannot initiate conversations with users so you have to send it a message first.

Assuming you did not make any changes to the `response` variable, the bot should respond with `Meow! Hi <username>. Hello world!` and your message should be printed on the terminal.

## Task 2 - Handling Message Events

#### 2.1 Commands

When processing a message, few pieces of information are presented which we will be using to determine the *intention* of the user. Much like instructions that you give to your cat (e.g. `sit`, `fetch` or `bark`), **commands** present a flexible yet semantic way to communicate with your bot. The following syntax may be used:

```
/command [optional] [argument]
```

As you may have noticed, commands start with `/` and may contain latin letters, numbers and underscores. We can suggest to the user what commands our bot understands by providing this information to BotFather. Doing so enables command suggestions where typing a `/` shows the user a list of available commands (more on this later).

For this section, we'll program our cat bot such that it would be able to recognize and behave *differently* provided the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/ask` | Returns a random fact about cats. |
| `/status` | Returns the status of the cat together with a random picture of it. |
| `/feed` | Returns the response of the cat after feeding it. |
| `/bathe` | Returns the response of the cat after bathing it. |
| `/kitty` | Murders your current cat and spawns you a new kitten. |

#### 2.3 Data Storage


#### 2.2 Keyboards

Besides receiving, parsing and sending message back and forth, Telegram Bots allow richer interactions with the user using keyboards.

#### 3.1 APIs

#### 3.2 Web Scraping

#### 3.3 Asynchronous

## Task 4 - Deployment

#### 4.1 Git
