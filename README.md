## Task 1 - BotFather

#### 1.1 Name Your Cat Bot

Since we need unique names for our Cat Bots, you can name your bot after your very own cat (or the cat you've never had). That way, BotFather won't likely complain about reserved usernames. If you don't have a cat, I've compiled a *Cat Name Matrix* aka "What's Your Cat Name" that could help you name your cat bot:

**Step 1:** Sum of the digits in your Matriculation Number mod 10

| Number | Name | Number | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `Mister` | 5 | `Moon` |
| 1 | `Miss` | 6 | `Sir` |
| 2 | `Lord` | 7 | `Captain` |
| 3 | `Lady` | 8 | `General` |
| 4 | `Princess` | 9 | `Professor` |

<br>**Step 2:** First initial of your given name

| Letter | Name | Letter | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | `Fluffy` | n | `Cuddles` |
| b | `Banana` | o | `Sparkly` |
| c | `Rainbow` | p | `Fatty` |
| d | `Mainbitch` | q | `Querty` |
| e | `Buddy` | r | `Hairy` |
| f | `Kissy` | s | `Sassy` |
| g | `Bitchy` | t | `Motherfucker` |
| h | `Kitty` | u | `Cutiepie` |
| i | `Handsome` | v | `Scratchy` |
| j | `Stormy` | w | `Moon` |
| k | `Pussy` | x | `Pouncey` |
| l | `Spiderpig` | y | `Lucky` |
| m | `Midnight` | z | `Snowy` |

<br>**Step 3:** Your GPA times your day of birth mod 10

| Digit | Name | Digit | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0  | `Bellyrubs` | 5 | `Waggles` |
| 1 | `Purbox` | 6 | `Furface` |
| 2 | `Wiggles` | 7 | `Fluffles` |
| 3 | `Munchkin` | 8 | `Moon` |
| 4 | `Cheeks` | 9 | `Meowers` |

For example, if my matriculation number is U1359234X, my cat bot's honorific would be `Captain` as derived from `(1+3+5+9+2+3+4)%10 = 7` . Combined with my name's first initial `C` (which maps to `Rainbow`) and given my *5.0* GPA times the day of my birth 20, `5.0*20%10 = 0` (which maps to `Bellyrubs`), my cat bot's full name would be `Captain Rainbow Bellyrubs`. Consequently, my cat bot's username would be `captainrainbowbellyrubscatbot`.

For you lazy bums out there, Steve built a bot that helps you figure out your cat name for you (code in the `examples` folder). Its name is `CatFather`. You can find it by its handle `@CatMotherBot` (because feminism?). Oh, and when you're done naming your cat, you will be greeted with the opportunity help us track our task completion rate. Neat, huh?

*We will host `CatFather` for this session only.*

#### 1.2 Acquire Telegram HTTP API Token

Once we've got our Cat Bot name settled, the next step is to acquire a token from Telegram. To do this, we need to let BotFather know that we want to create a bot. Open Telegram and search for *BotFather* in the contacts search field. Ask it to register a new bot for you by sending the command `/newbot` after which it'll ask you for your bot's name and username.

![task 1.2 screenshot](screenshots/task_1_2.png?raw=true)

Take note of our new bot's token to access Telegram's HTTP API as we'll need it in the code we're about to write so we can tell Telegram the behavior of our cat bot.

The token should look something like this:

```
2351749591:VskzWEJdWj_rlCx23Hyu5mIJdWjTVskzdEx
```

#### 1.3 Meow! Hello World

![task 1.3 screenshot a](screenshots/task_1_3_a.png?raw=true)

Now that we got everything we need to start developing our bot, let's start programming to define the behavioral aspects of our Cat Bot. To start off, open `catbot/catbot.py` on your text editor and paste the following snippet to where the indicated `TODO` is at (subsequent pasting of snippets will follow the same way):

```python
# TODO: Create Hello World

# default response (feel free to change it)
response = 'Meow!'

# handle only messages with text content
if content_type == 'text':

    # get message payload
    msg_text = msg['text']
    msg_sender = msg['from']['username']
    print('Received: "' + msg_text + '" from ' + msg_sender)

    # TODO: Implement Command Handling
    response += ' Hi ' + msg_sender + '. Hello world! '

# send the response
bot.sendMessage(chat_id, response)
```

Don't forget to add in our bot's API token:
```python
# TODO: Replace Token

TOKEN = '2351749591:VskzWEJdWj_rlCx23Hyu5mIJdWjTVskzdEx'
```

Let's bring our bot to life by running it. If you didn't get any errors this far, you should be able to test your bot by talking to it via Telegram Desktop. Enter your bot's username in the contacts search field and press `start` to begin the conversation. Remember that bots cannot initiate conversations with users so you have to send it a message first.

Assuming you did not make any changes to the `response` variable, the bot should respond with `Meow! Hi <username>. Hello world!` and your message should be printed on the terminal.

![task 1.3 screenshot b](screenshots/task_1_3_b.png?raw=true)

## Task 2 - Handling Message Events

#### 2.1 Commands

When processing a message, few pieces of information are presented which we will be using to determine the *intention* of the user. Much like instructions that you give to your cat (e.g. `sit`, `fetch` or `bark`), **commands** present a flexible yet semantic way to communicate with your bot. The following syntax may be used:

```
/command [optional] [argument]
```

As you may have noticed, commands start with `/` and may contain latin letters, numbers and underscores. We can suggest to the user what commands our bot understands by providing this information to BotFather. Doing so enables command suggestions where typing a `/` shows the user a list of available commands (more on this later).

For this section, we'll program our cat bot such that it would be able to recognize and behave *differently* provided the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/ask` | This command returns a random fact about cats. |
| `/status` | This command returns the status of the cat together with a random picture of it. |
| `/feed` | This command returns the response of the cat after feeding it. |
| `/clean` | This command returns the response of the cat after bathing it. |
| `/kitty` | This command murders your current cat if it's still alive and spawns you a new kitten. |

For this tutorial, we will be using a *very sophisticated* cat simulator class which has already been coded for us. You're free to explore the codes inside `catbot/cat.py` for personal learning, but it would be beyond the scope of this workshop. For now, use the information below as reference of the commands made available to us to use when interfacing with an instance of the Cat class.

-   Attributes:
    -   `name (str)`: Name of cat
    -   `hunger (int)`: Tracks how hungry the cat is (-100 to 100)
    -   `dirt (int)`: Tracks how dirty the cat is (-100 to 100)
    -   `cycles_passed (int)`: Tracks how many cycles (updates) the cat has been through
    -   `is_alive (bool)`: Indicates whether the cat is still alive

-   Methods:
    -   `get_status()`: Returns the cat's age, needs and whether if it's still alive
    -   `feed()`: Feeds the cat (hunger - 25); returns the cat's response after feeding
    -   `clean()`: Cleans the cat (dirt - 25); returns the cat's response after cleaning
    -   `chat()`: Returns a hyper realistic cat response

The idea is to take care of a simulated cat using our bot. The cat's behavior and states have already been taken care of by `cat.py`, so the only thing left for us to do is to link the class' methods to our `on_chat_message` function. Our user would then be able to *take care* of the cat via the commands provided.

![task 2.1 screenshot a](screenshots/task_2_1_a.png?raw=true)

Let's update our code by adding routing logic which would direct the program flow according to the user's command.

```python
# TODO: Implement Command Handling

if (msg_text.startswith('/')):

    # parse the command excluding the '/' and other arguments
    command = msg_text[1:].lower().split()[0]

    # prepare the correct response based on the given command
    if (command == 'ask'):
        # TODO: Call Get Random Cat Fact
        response = 'Meow? *licks paws*'
    elif (command == 'status'):
        response = cat_bot.get_status()
    elif (command == 'feed'):
        response = cat_bot.feed()
    elif (command == 'clean'):
        response = cat_bot.clean()
    elif (command == 'kitty'):

        # TODO: Confirm User Action Using Keyboard

        # kill cat if still alive
        if (cat_bot.is_alive):
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, 'Meow! *scratches your face*')
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, cat_bot.name + ' was killed.')

        # respawn cat
        cat_bot = Cat(bot_name)
        bot.sendMessage(chat_id, '*respawns ' + cat_bot.name + '*')

    # suggest the user to respawn the cat using /kitty
    if not (cat_bot.is_alive):
        response += ' You can respawn your cat using the command /kitty.'
else:

    # talk to the cat if no command was matched
    response = cat_bot.chat()
```

Notice that we can actually send multiple messages to the user within the context of a single message event (see where we handle `/kitty`). Since telepot's default implementation is *synchronous*, the user will still receive the messages in the very same order we're sending them.

![task 2.1 screenshot b](screenshots/task_2_1_b.png?raw=true)

#### 2.2 Keyboards

Besides receiving, parsing and sending message back and forth, Telegram Bots allow richer interactions with the user using keyboards. To prevent our user from *accidentally* `/kitty`-ing our live cat, we can prompt the user again to confirm this action. To do this, let's add an **Inline Keyboard** which we could use to prompt the user to confirm his/her action.

![task 2.2 screenshot a](screenshots/task_2_2_a.png?raw=true)

Replace the previous implementation of handling `/kitty` with the following:

```python
# TODO: Confirm User Action Using Keyboard

if (cat_bot.is_alive):

    # prepare confirm keyboard
    confirm_keyboard = InlineKeyboardMarkup(inline_keyboard=[
        [InlineKeyboardButton(text='Confirm', callback_data='kitty-confirm')],
        [InlineKeyboardButton(text='Cancel', callback_data='kitty-cancel')],
    ])

    # send response with keyboard
    response += ' Warning: ' + cat_bot.name + ' is still alive. Issuing this command will kill the cat (brutally) and reset all progress. Please confirm your action.'
    bot.sendMessage(chat_id, response, reply_markup = confirm_keyboard)
    return # prematurely terminate function call to await user response

else:

    # respawn cat
    cat_bot = Cat(bot_name)
    bot.sendMessage(chat_id, '*respawns ' + cat_bot.name + '*')
```

While you're at it, don't forget to import `InlineKeyboardMarkup` and `InlineKeyboardButton` from `telepot.namedtuple` at the beginning of our code. This will load the necessary classes required to build our inline keyboard.

```python
# TODO: Import Keyboards

from telepot.namedtuple import InlineKeyboardMarkup, InlineKeyboardButton
```

To handle the inline keyboard *on press* event, let's add some logic to our `on_callback_query`. This handler is to be called whenever the user presses any buttons on our custom keyboard. More specifically, this function is called whenever a callback query is initiated. Go ahead and paste the following code:

```python
# TODO: Handle Callback Query

# close inline keyboard
inline_message_id = msg['message']['chat']['id'], msg['message']['message_id']
bot.editMessageReplyMarkup(inline_message_id, reply_markup=None)

# kill cat (brutally) on confirm
if (query_data == 'kitty-confirm'):
    cat_bot = Cat(bot_name)
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, 'Meow!!!')
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, '*scratches your face*')
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, cat_bot.name + ' was killed.')

    #respawn cat
    cat_bot = Cat(bot_name)
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, '*respawns ' + cat_bot.name + '*')
else:
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, text='Meowww~~~')
    bot.sendMessage(from_id, text='*licks your face*')
```

![task 2.2 screenshot b](screenshots/task_2_2_b.png?raw=true)

Note that we've manually set the inline keyboard to hide itself when the user makes his/her selection. Leaving it on otherwise would leave a free *kill switch* lying around and I think that's not very healthy for our cat.

## Task 3 - Dynamic Content

#### 3.1 APIs

Now that we've finished most of our bot's basic functionalities, let's add some dynamic content to spice things up. I mean, wouldn't it be very nice to hear your cat say something smart for once - aside from that very mundane *meow* of course.

![task 3.1 screenshot](screenshots/task_3_1.png?raw=true)

APIs are application interfaces that use HTTP requests to query or update data. Most public databases usually expose an endpoint (aka API) free of charge, but others may require permission or a license to use. If you're looking for something free and easy, I recommend looking up [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/)'s catalog of APIs. I'm sure there's something over there you can use for your own projects.

For this step, we'll be using [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja) to give us a random cat fact (obviously). Technically, there are several ways to implement this but for simplicity, we will be using the library `requests` to help us send an HTTP GET request.

In `catbot/catbot.py`, create a function `get_random_cat_fact()` which sends an HTTP GET request to [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja), parses the response, and returns the cat fact as a string. Don't forget to import `requests` at the top of the file.

```python
# TODO: Get Random Cat Fact

def get_random_cat_fact():
    response = requests.get('https://catfact.ninja/fact').json()
    return response['fact']
```

```python
# TODO: Import Requests

import requests
```

Once that's done, we need to call this function inside our message handlers so our user can actually see the results. Back to where we did our command routing, replace the entire clause where `/ask` was previously handled with the following:

```python
# TODO: Call Get Random Cat Fact

# prepare response with random cat fact if cat is alive
if (cat_bot.is_alive):
    response = 'Meow! ' + get_random_cat_fact()
else:
    response = 'This cat is currently unavailable.'
```

#### 3.2 Web Scraping

Sometimes the information we need may not be easily accessible via an API. For cases like this, we need to use `BeautifulSoup4` to parse an HTML page, traverse to the DOM element as specified by a selector, and then extract the attribute or text which is the exact data that we need.

One way we could improve our cat bot is to send a random cat image every time the `/status` command is invoked. We could, of course, just manually save some cat pictures to a local folder somewhere, but that wouldn't really give us rich *dynamic* content because realistically, one can only have so much cat pictures in one computer.

![task 3.2 screenshot a](screenshots/task_3_2_a.png?raw=true)

There are probably hundreds of cat image collections out there (some even with APIs), but for this example, we'll be using [Cutestpaw]('www.cutestpaw.com') because of how simple they've structured their DOM tree. Similar to the previous step, add the following snippets to `catbot/catbot.py`:

```python
# TODO: Import Random and BeautifulSoup

import random
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

```python
# TODO: Get Random Cat Image URL

def get_random_cat_image_url():

    # get a random page number
    max_pages = 296
    random_page_number = random.randint(1, max_pages)

    # get the random page
    rand_cat_image_url = 'http://www.cutestpaw.com/tag/cats/page/' + str(random_page_number)
    response = requests.get(rand_cat_image_url)

    # load the page into bs4 and get random image
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    image_container = soup.find('div', {'id': 'photos'})
    images = image_container.find_all('img')
    random_image = random.choice(images)

    return random_image['src']
```

```python
# TODO: Send User Random Cat Image

bot.sendChatAction(chat_id, 'upload_photo')
bot.sendPhoto(chat_id, get_random_cat_image_url())
```

Notice that for this example, we're also using `requests` to fetch the HTML source. Also, since scraping takes a few extra seconds to do its thing, we need to give the user some sort of feedback to let him/her know what's going on. Instead of sending a message along the lines of “Uploading image, please wait…”, Telegram API already provides us with `sendChatAction` which does exactly what we want. The code above uses `upload_photo` to indicate the type of action.

![task 3.2 screenshot b](screenshots/task_3_2_b.png?raw=true)


## Task 4 - Deployment

The final step is to free our cat bot into the wild, that is, to get it deployed on a server. Of course there's always the option to keep your laptop or device running, but why do that when you can get it up and running on a remote server *for free*?

To do this, login to your Heroku dashboard ([sign up here](https://signup.heroku.com) if you still don't have one) and create a new app like this:

![task 4 screenshot a](screenshots/task_4_a.png?raw=true)

There's no specific naming convention for catbot deployment applications, but for this instance, let's name our app after our cat like this: `captain-rainbow-bellyrubs-bot` (use your cat's own name you dummy). Note that by default, free accounts only get access to US and Europe servers but it shouldn't be a problem for us whichever region we choose.

Once that's done, head over to *Deployment* in the *Deploy* tab of your new app and link your Dropbox  account ([sign up here](https://db.tt/v1tjjEafrg) if you still don't have one).

As you can see, there are other options for us to choose, but to make thing simple, we're only covering the Dropbox method for this workshop. I recommend you also try the *git* method - you'll learn a lot more useful stuff that way.

If things go as planned, you should see something like the screenshot below after linking your Dropbox account.

![task 4 screenshot b](screenshots/task_4_b.png?raw=true)

Next, we need to copy all of our files into the directory specified in the previous step: `Dropbox/Apps/Heroku/captain-rainbow-bellyrubs-bot`. This one shouldn't be that tough since you've already installed and connected your Dropbox account to your laptop. Just hit the *Deploy* button once all your files are uploaded.

![task 4 screenshot c](screenshots/task_4_c.png?raw=true)

Finally, to actually get our bot running, we need to tell Heroku to give us a free *dyno* (something like a processor). Go to *Free Dynos* under the *Resources* tab and enable the toggle button where it says `worker python catbot/catbot.py`. It should look something like this assuming you've followed the steps correctly.

![task 4 screenshot d](screenshots/task_4_d.png?raw=true)


## 5 Maintaining Separate Conversations

#### 5.1 - Keeping Users Separate

Normally, a bot is made to be used by more than one user. You wouldn't want your users' messages to get mixed up, would you? No, that's not very *classy*. This is why have to create separate instances for each user.

This next part is a little tricky - we are going to take all the previous code you wrote... and throw them out the window!

Nah, but we are gonna wrap it in something called a `class`.

First, open up `examples/multi_catbot.py`. Navigate way below the huge chunks of text (they will be for later), until you get to the line `class MessageCounter(telepot.helper.ChatHandler):`. Paste the code for the catbot functions under the appropriate function names.

*If you look at the imported modules section at the top, you may see a couple of additional imports. The one that helps us keep separate conversations is `DelegatorBot`.*

```python
class MessageCounter(telepot.helper.ChatHandler):


   def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
      super(MessageCounter, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
      self.state = 0
      self.language = ''
      self.feel = 0
      self.ans = 0


   # TODO: Paste functions here (make sure the indentations are right)
   #-------------- Insert catboy functions in between ---------------#
   def get_random_cat_fact(self):
      return

   def get_random_cat_image_url(self):
      return

   def on_chat_message(self, msg):
      return

   def on_callback_query(self, msg):
      return
   #-----------------------------------------------------------------#
```
Your sharp eyes may have noticed the additional argument `self` for each function. This is an *Object-Oriented Programming* concept, where we create an `object` for each user. Each of these `objects` have the same starting attributes, and are independent of one another.

Now, just add your own API token in, and let `DelegatorBot` do the rest of the heavy lifting.

```python
# TODO: Insert own API token here
TOKEN = ''
bot = telepot.DelegatorBot(TOKEN,
                           [pave_event_space()
                            (per_chat_id(),
                             create_open,
                             MessageCounter,
                             timeout=100),])
```                             
That's it! Give yourself a pat on the back you clever cat you.


#### Task 5.2 - That's Not It (Maintaining a Conversation)

Often, people are looking for more than just a Q&A catbot. They are looking for a catbot  who will respond based on your responses to their responses (and so forth). A catbot with whom they might share a genuine conversation.

Okay, maybe it's not entirely genuine, but it's pretty close. We will use the idea of *saved states* to build a catbot who will actually listen and care.
*(Warning: catbot may not listen or care)*

The concept is pretty simple:
Let `State 0` be the so called "rest state". When you initiate a specific interaction with the catbot, it will move on to the next state `State 10`.

At `State 10`, the catbot can do a specific set of tasks. Based on user input, the catbot can then move on to other states, where it can perform other sets of tasks specific to that given state.

Whew, I hope I hadn't bored you off yet. Let's do a bit of coding, shall we? First, let's initialise the state with a new command `/speak`. Insert it just after the condition for the `/kitty` command.

```python
             # kill cat function 'kitty' (why would you)
             elif (command == 'kitty'):
                 # blah blah blah kill this cat

             # TODO: insert 'speak' condition
             # begin interaction with saved states with 'speak' command
             elif (command == 'speak' and self.state == 0):
                 self.state = 10

                 # prepares a custom keyboard
                 markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
                     [KeyboardButton(text='English')], [KeyboardButton(text='Spanish')],
                     [KeyboardButton(text='German')], [KeyboardButton(text='Nevermind')]
                 ])
                 bot.sendMessage(chat_id, 'Meow meow mrow hisss:\n1. English\
                 \n2. Spanish\n3. German', reply_markup=markup)
```

As you can see, if a user sends a `/speak` command at `State 0`, `State 10` will be initialised, and a custom keyboard is generated to help the user further the conversation, in English, Spanish, or German! Now that is one multilingual cat!

Now, let's alter more code such that we can insert additional states. Replace this segment here:

```python
else:

    # talk to the cat if no command was matched
    response = cat_bot.chat()
```
With the following:

```python
else:
    # TODO: insert interactions with various states (0 to 30)

    # separates responses into before and after 'speak' has been called
    if (self.state > 0):
        command = msg_text.lower()

        # TODO: insert code for state 10


        # TODO: add in code for state 20


        # TODO: add in state 30


    else:
        # talk to the cat if no command was matched
        # and 'speak' not initialised
        response = cat_bot.chat()
```
Now, for `State 10`, we'll make catbot give a warm greeting based on the language the user chose in the previous state. The custom keyboard gives the options to continue or end the "conversation".

```python
# TODO: insert code for state 10

# first state after initialisation, assign language based on
# user choice
if (self.state == 10):
   if (command != "nevermind"):
       if (command == "english"):
           self.language = 'eng'
           self.state = 20
           markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
               [KeyboardButton(text='I am indeed')], [KeyboardButton(text='Nope')]
           ])
           resp = "Well met! Ah, a fellow purveyor of the Anglo-Saxon tongue, I see."
       elif (command == "spanish"):
           self.language = 'spa'
           self.state = 20
           markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
               [KeyboardButton(text='Si senor')], [KeyboardButton(text='No se')]
           ])
           resp = "Hola mi amigo! Parece que hablas espanol. Te gustaria hablar conmigo?"

       elif (command == "german"):
           self.language = 'ger'
           self.state = 20
           markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
               [KeyboardButton(text='Ja')], [KeyboardButton(text='Nein')]
           ])
           resp = "Heute Deutschland, morgen die ganze welt! Warte, ich scherze nur! Komm zuruck!"
       bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp, reply_markup=markup)
   else:
       self.state = 0
       resp = "*perhaps it's best to not think about it, eh?"
       bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp)

```

Now, if the user chooses to go along with the "conversation", `State 20` will be initialised. This is where the top portion with all the lists of texts comes in. I'm sorry, but this is basically how you fill the vocabulary of a chat bot. It's the ugly truth no one wants to hear.

Catbot will ask a random question from the list, with a custom keyboard of the available answers. Choose wisely! For there is actually a correct answer to each question.

```python
# TODO: add in code for state 20

# second state after initialisation, takes in user input and asks
# a question accordingly
elif (self.state == 20):
    resp = ''
    self.feel = random.randrange(3)
    if (self.language == 'eng'):
        if (command == 'i am indeed'):
            self.state = 30
            markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
                [KeyboardButton(text='I love it')], [KeyboardButton(text='Meh')],
                [KeyboardButton(text='I hate it')], [KeyboardButton(text='I want out')]
            ])
            resp += random.choice(eng_prompt)
            resp += random.choice(englist[self.feel])
            resp += '?'
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp, reply_markup=markup)
        else:
            self.state = 0
            resp = "That's a shame."
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp)
    elif (self.language == 'ger'):
        if (command == 'ja'):
            self.state = 30
            markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
                [KeyboardButton(text='Ich liebe es')], [KeyboardButton(text='Meh')],
                [KeyboardButton(text='Ich hasse es')], [KeyboardButton(text='Ich will gehen')]
            ])
            resp += random.choice(ger_prompt)
            resp += random.choice(gerlist[self.feel])
            resp += '?'
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp, reply_markup=markup)
        else:
            self.state = 0
            resp = "Das ist zu schade."
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp)
    elif (self.language == 'spa'):
        if (command == 'si senor'):
            self.state = 30
            markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(one_time_keyboard=True,keyboard=[
                [KeyboardButton(text='Me gusta')], [KeyboardButton(text='Meh')],
                [KeyboardButton(text='No me gusta')], [KeyboardButton(text='Quiero irme')]
            ])
            resp += random.choice(spa_prompt)
            resp += random.choice(spalist[self.feel])
            resp += '?'
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp, reply_markup=markup)
        else:
            self.state = 0
            resp = "Eso es muy malo."
            bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp)

```

Next, assuming the user hasn't quit the conversation yet, `State 30` is initialised. Here, catbot responds based on the user's previous answer. For example, catbot asked about `Hitler` and the answer is `I love it!`, then catbot will be angry, and respond with a random insult. *This goes for real life - don't go around telling people you love Hitler. It won't end well for you*

```python
# TODO: add in state 30

# third state after initialisation, takes in user input, remembers
# the previous question, and responds in the context of the question in the second state
elif (self.state == 30):
    resp = ''
    if (command == 'i love it' or command == 'ich liebe es' or command == 'me gusta'):
        self.ans = 0
    elif (command == 'meh'):
        self.ans = 1
    elif (command == 'i hate it' or command == 'ich hasse es' or command == 'no me gusta'):
        self.ans = 2
    else:
        self.ans = 3

    if (self.ans == 3):
        self.state = 0
        resp = "*Was it all a dream? You could have sworn that cat just spoke to you..."
    else:
        if self.language == 'eng':
            if (self.feel == self.ans):
                resp = random.choice(eng_goodresp)
            else:
                resp = random.choice(eng_badresp)
        elif self.language == 'ger':
            if (self.feel == self.ans):
                resp = random.choice(ger_goodresp)
            else:
                resp = random.choice(ger_badresp)
        elif self.language == 'spa':
            if (self.feel == self.ans):
                resp = random.choice(spa_goodresp)
            else:
                resp = random.choice(spa_badresp)
        self.state = 0
        bot.sendMessage(chat_id, resp)
```

Thus ends this "conversation". The state reverts back to `State 0`. Of course, you can always insert more states to extend the feeling of actually talking to someone.

This is it for interacting with saved states. The full, working code may be found under `examples/multi_catbot.py`.
